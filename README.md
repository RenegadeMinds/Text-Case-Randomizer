## Homoglyphs?

A homoglyph is a character that looks like another character. Perhaps the simplest example is the upper case letter "O" and the number zero "0". However, there are **many** more in the unicode specification. The homoglyphs used in this software is a curated short list of the most similar ones. 

Characters currently supported for homoglyphs include a-z, A-Z, 0-9, and the dash "-" and period "." characters.
